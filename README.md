# Football Application in Flutter

## About
This is a footabll application where football enthusiast can track of all the major leagues in football at one place using api-football API.
Since I am a beginner there might be many improvements required which I will do in future (mentioned in the future section).

## Future Work
1. I will use Provider state management to manage states properly
2. Handling the exceptions properly like the slow internet connections will give network image error , etc

## Contributors 
Feel free to contribute by raising issue and making pull request.
I have removed my personal api key , so you will have to get your own api key by sign up to api-football.
